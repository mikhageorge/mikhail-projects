Database and web application for a student advising system : 
• The implemented database system accommodates Admins, Advisors, and Advising Students, each with specific
roles and permissions. Admins modify system information and handle requests. Advisors create and edit
graduation plans for students with over 157 credit hours, with each student assigned one advisor per semester,
though advisors can manage multiple students. Students can request extra credit hours or courses if not on
probation, limited to 3 credit hours while staying below 34 total credit hours, with each additional hour costing
1000 LE added to the next payment due. They can also register for makeup exams, with all students eligible for
the first makeup, and second makeup eligibility limited to those who failed or missed the first and have no more
than 2 failed courses in odd or even semesters. Instructors are assigned to courses and slots , while payments
can be divided into installments.
