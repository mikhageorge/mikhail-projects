Labs scheduling system :
• A system was developed to allocate weekly lab sessions of a course to available TAs. Each lab was assigned
precisely one TA, and each TA had a specified teaching load, representing the number of labs they needed to
teach per week. The system ensured that no TA was assigned more labs than their teaching load, though they
could be assigned fewer. Additionally, the system restricted the number of slots assigned to each TA per day
to a specified limit.
• The project was implemented using Prolog

A donation application for NGO :
• In milestone 1 , we were asked to write 150 consistent and complete functional and non-functional user stories
to cover the functionalities that should be provided by the application .
• In milestone 2 , A complete front-end was implemented for the application but with user stories provided to us
by the course instructor .
• Milestone 2 was implemented using CSS , HTML5 and JavaScript .

Database and web application for a student advising system : 
• The implemented database system accommodates Admins, Advisors, and Advising Students, each with specific
roles and permissions. Admins modify system information and handle requests. Advisors create and edit
graduation plans for students with over 157 credit hours, with each student assigned one advisor per semester,
though advisors can manage multiple students. Students can request extra credit hours or courses if not on
probation, limited to 3 credit hours while staying below 34 total credit hours, with each additional hour costing
1000 LE added to the next payment due. They can also register for makeup exams, with all students eligible for
the first makeup, and second makeup eligibility limited to those who failed or missed the first and have no more
than 2 failed courses in odd or even semesters. Instructors are assigned to courses and slots , while payments
can be divided into installments.
• a full schema was made in milestone 1 of this project , the database engine was implemented in milestone 2
using SQL . a front-end was implemented in milestone 3 using ASP.NET forms.

Von Neumann architecture simulation :
• The project simulates a fictional processor design and architecture called "Fillet-O-Neumann with moves on the
side,"based on the Von Neumann design where data and instructions share the same memory. It supports three
instruction formats: R-type for register-to-register operations (arithmetic and logical), I-type for operations
with immediate values (loading, storing, branching, and immediate arithmetic/logical), and J-type for jump
instructions. The code implements the RISC pipeline logic through five stages: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory
Access, and Write-back, with stage logic varying based on the instruction type.
• The project was implemented using C

The last of us game
• Implemented a single player game for survival in a world filled with zombies using OOP concepts. the player
can choose to play with different characters and each character has a special action . players can only move
within a 15*15 grid and they may find traps on some cells that decrease the player’s health or supplies that
increase the player’s health or allow the player to use his special action. when the player kills a zombie , another
one will spawn on the map and the game doesn’t end except when the player collects and uses all vaccines (type
of supplies ) or when all the heroes are defeated by zombies.
• The game engine was implemented with java in milestone 1 and 2 of this project . the GUI for the game was
implemented in milestone 3 using javaFX

Operating system simulation :
• The project code simulates an operating system by implementing the round robin (RR) scheduling algorithm
to manage system processes. It includes creating an interpreter to read and execute code from text files,
implementing memory management to store processes, and using mutexes to ensure mutual exclusion over
critical resources.
• The project was implemented using C
